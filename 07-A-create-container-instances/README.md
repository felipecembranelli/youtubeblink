## Creating App Services

To save time, we have an ARM template to get a few Azure resources created:

- App Services (Used to store Docker Images for the UI Application and Backend API Service)
- App Service Plan (Resources needed to host the application and services)

Go ahead and Deploy to Azure

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ffelipecembranelli%2Fyoutubeblink%2Frefs%2Fheads%2FNEW_ARCHITECTURE%2F03-B-Create-app-services%2Fazuredeploy-app-svc.json)


> üìù Please Note, Create a new resource when prompted, such as: **rg-video-summary** and substitute your network alias for **youralias**, or something unique that will appear as a FQDN for accessing your Azure Pet Store Application.

You should see something similar to the below image:
